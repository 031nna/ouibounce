# Bounce Exchange Alternative [![alt text][1]][1.1]

A small library that enables you to display a modal before a user leaves your website. This was inspired by [BounceExchange](http://bounceexchange.com/).


### The philosophy behind this project
This library helps you increase your landing page conversion rates. Use it to provide value to your visitors. With tools like these it's very easy to create something spammy-looking that provides little value to prospective customers.

### Installation
Download the minified script and include it in your HTML head.

### Usage
- Create a hidden modal
- Select the modal with jQuery and call ouibounce as such 

```js
$('#ouibounce-modal').ouibounce();
```


### Example
[Live example](http://colors.carlsednaoui.com/)
